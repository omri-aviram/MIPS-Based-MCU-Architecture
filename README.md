# MIPS-Based-MCU-Architecture
This project implements a full MCU system on FPGA, based on a  scalar pipelined MIPS processor. The system integrates core  CPU functionality with memory, bus infrastructure, and  memory-mapped peripherals, creating a working  microcontroller-like environment.  The design was written in VHDL
